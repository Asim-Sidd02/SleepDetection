# SleepDetection
Sleep Detection with Eye Movement
Description
This GitHub project is designed to detect sleep with eye movement using computer vision techniques. It utilizes the powerful libraries imutils, dlib, and cv2 (OpenCV) to analyze video streams or images and identify patterns associated with drowsiness or sleep. The application can be useful for monitoring driver fatigue, ensuring alertness during critical tasks, or any other scenario where detecting sleep patterns through eye movements is essential.

Features
Real-time sleep detection using webcams or video streams.
Processing of recorded videos to identify sleep patterns.
Customizable sensitivity settings for detection accuracy.
Simple integration with other projects due to lightweight dependencies.
Cross-platform compatibility.
